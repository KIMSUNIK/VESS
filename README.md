##VESS (Virtual Engine Sound System)
#Objective
This project aims to develop a Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS), a system that generates artificial driving sounds for vehicles with little to no powertrain noise, such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles (HEVs).

The quiet nature of these vehicles poses a significant safety risk to pedestrians, cyclists, and especially the visually impaired, who rely on auditory cues to detect an approaching vehicle. To mitigate this risk, many countries now mandate the use of an Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS). VESS is the core technology that powers AVAS.

This system is designed to alert pedestrians to the vehicle's presence, location, and behavior (e.g., accelerating or decelerating) by generating adaptive virtual engine sounds in real-time, based on live vehicle data.

#Key Features
This repository will focus on implementing the following key features:

Real-time Sound Synthesis:
Dynamically generate a rich and responsive soundscape based on vehicle data such as speed, acceleration, and throttle position.

Customizable Sound Profiles:
Allow users to select from a variety of pre-loaded sound profiles or create and fine-tune their own to give the vehicle a unique acoustic signature.

Scenario-Adaptive Audio:
Output distinct and intuitive sounds that correspond to different driving states, including:

- Acceleration
- Deceleration
- Constant speed (cruising)
- Idling / Stationary

#Motivation
The primary motivation for this project is to enhance pedestrian safety in an increasingly electrified automotive world. By creating a robust and realistic VESS, we can help prevent accidents and ensure a safer environment for everyone sharing the road.
